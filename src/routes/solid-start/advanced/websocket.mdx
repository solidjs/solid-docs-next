title: Websocket Endpoint
---

Websocket endpoint may be included by passing the ws handler file you specify in your start config.
Note that this feature is [experimental on the Nitro server](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/websocket#opt-in-to-the-experimental-feature) and its config may change in future releases of SolidStart. Use it with caution.

```js
import { defineConfig } from "@solidjs/start/config";

export default defineConfig({
	server: {
		experimental: {
			websocket: true,
		},
	},
}).addRouter({
	name: "party",
	type: "http",
	handler: "./src/ws.ts",
	target: "server",
	base: "/ws",
});
```

Inside the ws file, you can export a partyHandler function to manage WebSocket connections and events:

```tsx
import { partyHandler } from "vinxi/party";

export default partyHandler({
	onConnect(party, conn) {
		conn.send(`Hello from the server!: ${conn.id}`);
	},
	onMessage(party, msg, con) {
		con.send(`${party.id} receive: ${msg}`);
	},
});
```

The partyHandler supports 6 event callbacks:

- `onStart`: Invoked when the party room is firstly created.
- `onConnect`: Invoked when a new connection is established.
- `onMessage`: Invoked when a message is received.
- `onClose`: Invoked when a connection is closed.
- `onError`: Invoked when an error occurs.
- `onRequest`: Invoked on a HTTP request is made to the party URL.

The `party.id` represents the URL path that is shared between all connections in the party.

Beside `partyHandler` you can also use `eventHandler` to have a more precise control.
